/**
 * One bounded, promise-sharing memo for the plugin's "resolve once per credential" lookups
 * (OAuth profile ARN, API-key profile ARN).
 *
 * The memo owns the mechanics; the loader owns the policy:
 *   - a loader that RESOLVES (even to a fallback) is cached like any value;
 *   - a loader that REJECTS is evicted, so the next call retries.
 *
 * Keys are caller-supplied strings (callers memoizing by credential pass a digest, so the memo
 * never holds a raw secret). Scopes are objects held weakly (in production, the fetch function),
 * which is what lets tests isolate themselves by handing in a fresh instance.
